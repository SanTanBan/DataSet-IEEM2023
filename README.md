The DOI of my Conference Proceeding in [IEEM 2023](https://ieem.org/): https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEM58616.2023.10406762

This repository contains Datasets for the (large) Instances 8 to 15 of Table 4 of the above paper (notice that the exact formulation was unable to find any feasible solution for these cases within 24 hours).

### The conference presentation as presented on the 19th of December 2023 is also uploaded in this repository (with intimation to the organizers).

Supplementary DataSets (for replicating the Comparison Table) may be found here: https://github.com/SanTanBan/mHFVRPSDP-DataSet

### To see my implementation of the heuristics in [Avci and Topaloglu's 2016 paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.01.038):
1. The original implementation: https://github.com/SanTanBan/PaperHeuristic
2. The 2016 paper by Avci and Topaloglu has variations in their Heuristic description (it is described differently in their Text, Flowchart and Algorithm) and all 3 logics for each of HLS and ATS is implemented: https://github.com/SanTanBan/Avci-Topaloglu-Paper-Heuristic-for-Comparing-with-Table-3
3. Includes solutions of the 35 Node instance of Avci & Topaloglu's 2016 paper by their own heuristic as implemented by me: https://github.com/SanTanBan/HLS-and-ATS-Heuristic-from-Avci-Topaloglu-2016-Paper-for-Comparing-with-the-35-Nodes
